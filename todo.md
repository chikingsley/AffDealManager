Would you like me to start with any particular section? I suggest we begin with the UI mockups as they'll help validate the data structure and user workflows.

Also, should we prioritize certain features? For example, we could focus first on:
1. Deal management
2. Lead processing
3. Financial tracking

Since these seem to be the most critical daily operations.
