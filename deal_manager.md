**Project Summary:**
This is a Telegram bot designed to help manage and search affiliate marketing deals stored in Notion. The bot enables quick inline searching of deals, allowing users to find and share deal information based on various criteria like geography, language, and pricing. It provides a streamlined way to access and share deal information from Notion, with a focus on fast response times and user-friendly formatting.

**Key Features:**
1. Inline Search Functionality
   - Quick search across multiple parameters
   - Real-time results as you type
   - Custom formatted display of deal information

2. Multi-Select Capability
   - Select multiple deals simultaneously
   - Save selections for batch sharing
   - Clear selections when needed

3. Custom Formatting
   - Search display format: `Partner [Sources] Geo Language Price`
   - Paste format: `Geo Language [Sources] Price`
   - Automated funnel list formatting

4. Caching System
   - Fast response times
   - Reduced Notion API calls
   - Cached formatted strings

**Tech Stack:**
1. Core Technologies:
   - Python (FastAPI or Flask for API endpoints)
   - Python-telegram-bot (for Telegram integration)
   - Notion API (for database integration)

2. Search & Caching:
   - Typesense (for fast search)
   - Redis (for caching)

3. Infrastructure:
   - Docker (for containerization)
   - Cloud hosting (AWS/GCP/DigitalOcean)

**Components to Build:**

1. **Notion Integration Layer**
   - Sync service for Notion database
   - Deal parser and formatter
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Consider: How often to sync? Real-time or periodic?

2. **Search Infrastructure**
   - Typesense setup and configuration
   - Index management
   - Search optimization
   - Consider: Do we need full Typesense capabilities or can we simplify?

3. **Caching System**
   - Redis implementation
   - Cache invalidation strategy
   - Backup mechanisms
   - Consider: What specifically needs caching? Just formatted strings or more?

4. **Telegram Bot Interface**
   - Command handling
   - Inline search implementation
   - Message formatting
   - Error handling
   - Consider: Additional features like deal statistics or reports?

5. **Data Management System**
   - Database schema design
   - Data validation
   - Error logging
   - Consider: Do we need a separate database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for additional features?

**Recommendations and Considerations:**

1. **Simplified Search First:**
   - Start with basic Redis caching and simple search
   - Add Typesense only if needed for scale
   - Could potentially use PostgreSQL with full-text search initially

3. **Phased Implementation:**
   Phase 1:
   - Basic Notion sync
   - Simple search with Redis cache
   - Basic Telegram commands
   
   Phase 2:
   - Advanced search with Typesense
   - Multi-select functionality
   - Enhanced caching
   
   Phase 3:
   - Analytics and reporting
   - User preferences
   - Advanced features

4. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   - Implement logging
   - Error tracking
   - Performance monitoring
   - Regular database maintenance
